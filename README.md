# What?
This are my public and ecrypted private keys for a number of tools and services that I use. It also includes a bunch of small utilities that I have created to leverage from these credentials.

Mostly, my public GPG key.

# Why?
Because reasons. It is easy and useful to have a copy of all your credentials on github, since it has high availability and the underlaying technology, git, offers an easy way to manage versioning.

# Can I use it?
The tools and configurations for sure. Also, feel free to use my public key to send messages or whatever.
